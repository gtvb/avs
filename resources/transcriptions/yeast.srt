As an OB-GYN who specializes in Volvo vaginal disorders,

1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,080
I hear a lot of myths about vaginal yeast infections.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,680
And the one that just won't go away

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,480
is that they're linked to too much sugar in your diet.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,440
On the surface, the idea sounds plausible.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,760
After all, sugar is a food source, not just for us,

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,920
but also for yeast and bacteria.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,440
So if we eat more sugar, we're feeding the yeast.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,000
And there are studies that show yeast infections

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,060
are more common in people with diabetes,

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,660
who can have higher levels of sugar in their blood.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,400
But the truth is, the sugar consumption yeast connection

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,240
is a myth for most.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,240
Prepechuated, both by well-meaning, but ill-informed

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,120
health care professionals, as well as purveyors of snake oil.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,120
You know, the ones who want to sell you cleanses, diets,

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,080
and books designed to help you get rid of all the yeast.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,520
The first thing you need to know is that yeast

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,760
is normally found in the vagina.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,600
At some point in a given year, one study estimates

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,240
that 70% of people will have yeast in their vagina,

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,040
just hanging out in the microbiome and causing no symptoms.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,400
And secondly, sugar is normally found in the vagina.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
After all, that's what also feeds the good bacteria.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,360
It's the overgrowth of this yeast that's already there

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,560
to produce a symptoms and results in what we call

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,680
a yeast infection.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,480
One theory for the sugar yeast connection

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,160
is that the source of the yeast is actually in the gut,

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,000
and that a high sugar diet feeds this yeast,

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,360
which makes it overgrow, and then it gets into the vagina.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,840
But there's no credible data to support this.

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,560
Another theory is that eating more sugar

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,720
causes sugar levels in the vagina to rise,

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,240
thus feeding the yeast.

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,240
But it doesn't, and yes, someone actually studied this.

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,800
Researchers gave people some with a history

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,440
of vaginal yeast infections and others without a drink

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,240
containing a lot of sugar or glucose.

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,160
Their blood and vaginal sugar levels were measured

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,840
before and after the drink.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,280
They found that the sugar levels in vaginal secretions

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,440
didn't change for either group.

43
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,920
But what about diabetes?

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,520
Now, we know diabetes is associated

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,680
with increased risk of vaginal yeast infections,

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,000
but the actual reason why isn't known?

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,800
While very elevated glucose levels might be part of it,

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,640
it seems the immune system and other factors

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,360
may also be playing a role.

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,120
There is a newer class of diabetes medications

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,360
that causes people to dump a lot of sugar into their urine

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,000
as a way to lower blood sugar.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,260
The massive amounts of sugar in the urine

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
can cause yeast infections on the vulva.

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,880
As the vulva is being bathed in levels of sugar,

56
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,840
it didn't evolve to handle.

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,200
But unless you have diabetes,

58
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,560
there is no link between eating sugar and yeast infections.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,060
So ignore the so-called influencers.

60
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,480
It's fine to enjoy a slice of cake now and then,

61
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,320
and definitely skip the cleanses.
